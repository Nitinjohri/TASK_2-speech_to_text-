I have made a code for speech to text translation for which individual can speak while using english words or sentences which can be later 
transcribed to text words, i have also used google free speech recognition API for speech to text transcribe.I have used convertion code in 
this of mp3 audio to wav audio for code simplicity.I am also droping my transcribed text in this for better understanding.
1) Audio Format Conversion
 Many speech recognition systems work best with specific audio formats. In this case, an audio file originally in MP3 format 
 (a compressed format) is converted to WAV format, which is uncompressed and preserves the audio quality necessary for 
 accurate speech recognition
2) Speech Recognition (Speech-to-Text)
 Once the audio is in the correct format, it is analyzed by a speech recognition engine. The engine detects and interprets the
 spoken words in the audio signal and converts them into text. This typically involves:
-Breaking down the audio into frames
-Identifying phonemes (basic units of sound)
-Mapping those phonemes to likely words using a language model
 In this case, a cloud-based speech recognition service (like Googleâ€™s) is used, which sends the audio data to servers where
 machine learning models process it and return the transcribed text.
 outputs:
 Transcription: artificial intelligence emerged as a transformative force in various sectors and education is no exception over the
 last decade the integration of AI into the educational system has grown rapidly from personalized learning tools to automatic
 trading system is reshaping the way student learn and teacher
